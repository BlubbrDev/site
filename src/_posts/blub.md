A day of overcast Washington skies had given way to a dark night of scattered showers, a warning sign of the storm that was fast approaching. But the thought of taking refuge inside the house had not crossed my mind. Despite my lanky 6’ 2” stature, I couldn’t reach the top of the structure without leaning outward as I balanced on one foot on the very top step of a teetering metal ladder.

The glass door squealed as it violently slid open.

“What ​on earth​ do you think you’re doing?” questioned my mom.

I almost fell as I spun around to meet the disapproving gaze of my mother.

Busted. With her eyebrows raised sharply, she took her hands off of her hips to gesture me inside. I was anxious to finally see the project to completion — a highly unlikely outcome according to my parents — but the project would just have to wait one more day. And judging by the look on her face, maybe two.

It was late-spring and my latest engineering project had taken the form of a greenhouse. Like many of my past projects, this was no ordinary greenhouse. It was a tech-infused geodesic dome complete with automatic vents, temperature-controlled fans, and its very own Twitter page. With an elaborate idea of how the dome would solve the ecological perils of industrial agriculture, I recruited three of my closest friends and we got to work.

Growing up in a multi-generational family of artists, I was a bit of a black sheep. My father, in particular, would frequently boast of his enduring three-year quest to pass “Math-107” in college. My parents are the hardest working people I know, yet somehow they also found time to nurture my scientific curiosity. After each long day of unpaid overtime at the architecture firm he worked at, my father would set his bag down, come into my room, and flop down beside me in bed ready with another Magic Box Problem:

“I have three baseball hats, each filled with 72 baseballs. How many baseballs do I have?”​ ​The problems were simple, but they were the highlight of my day.

The summer before freshman year, the economy turned and both my parents lost their jobs. I didn’t know it then, but the nights of Magic Box Problems were over. The impediment sparked nightly hushed conversations about finances from my parent’s bedroom, and for a time, my mom worked two jobs just to make ends meet. They persevered and eventually were both hired by firms in Seattle, a two hour’s commute each way from our home. Instead of staying late, my parents now wake up at 4:45 AM to take the first bus up to Seattle, not returning home until 8:00 PM.

I don’t get to see my parents much, but their persistence and dedication aren’t foreign to me. My nocturnal parents taught me those fundamental characteristics every night after flopping down beside me in bed. So when I aspired to build a greenhouse, I knew the only design that would fly in the Shaw household was the geodesic dome. Both a feat of engineering and a work of art, the dome is a fusion of the two worlds, just like me.

Early the next morning, I was back outside. Equipped with a sorry excuse for a rain jacket and my dad’s trusty old tool belt, which wrapped around my waist twice but still sagged, I climbed up the teetering ladder. The air compressor sputtered to life as I drove the first staple into the cedar frame. We were low on materials and the weather wasn’t great so I knew I wouldn’t finish that day, but I’d be damned if I let the impediment keep me from trying.

After all, dome wasn’t built in a day.
